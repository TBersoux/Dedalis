# Dedalis
A little maze generator made to train my algorithm skills.

Only a single path go from one cell to another. It's also true for the enter and the exit.

To compile, use qmake and make then execute the compiled code.

Current features :
- Randomly generate a maze. Max size under a minute is 300x300
