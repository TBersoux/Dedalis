# Dedalis
A little maze generator made to train my algorithm skills.

Only a single path go from one cell to another. It's also true for the enter and the exit.

To compile, use qmake and make.
To use with the GUI, just run the exe. 
You can also call the exe with two parameters, width and weight (eg: ./dedalis 50 50) to run it without GUI.
